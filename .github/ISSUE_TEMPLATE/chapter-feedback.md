Here's my review of your first chapter. The format is as follows: for each of the steps, you find here the topics we check for compliance. If the topic is addressed by your work, it is checked off. If it is not yet addressed by your work, the check-box is open and I included some remarks on what you can do to ensure your work meets our guidelines. We will go over this list in detail during our weekly check-in.

As you go through the feedback and implement suggestions, please mark tasks as completed if you feel you have done so.

- [ ] Is it clear from the outline which concepts will be tested?

   We believe that our students practice best when the exercises are challenging and diverse. To that end, we encourage you to ensure a good mix of various exercise types in each chapter. Here's the mix we propose: MultipleChoiceChallenges < 25%, OutputChallenges < 35%, and BlanksChallenges â‰¥ 40%.
